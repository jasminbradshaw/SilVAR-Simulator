# SilVAR-Simulator

Final_GUI.ino contains the code for the SilVAR Simulator, a physical simulator for the EVAR procedure. The simulator includes patient-specific silicone abdominal aortic
aneurysm models, and a fluid pump system containing a centrifugal micropump, touch screen graphical user interface (GUI), Arduino Uno, and other electronics.

This code allows operation of a 4D Systems touch screen graphical user interface (GUI). Buttons on the GUI control the operation of a pump, enabling priming of the pump, 
operation of the pump at a constant flow rate, and operation of the pump with a pulsatile flow pattern. 

This project was completed as part of a Bachelor of Medical Engineering (Honours) at the University of Newcaslte.
